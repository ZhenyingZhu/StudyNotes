# Web App

[ASP.NET Tech Options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/choose-web-ui?view=aspnetcore-5.0)

- ASP.NET Core Razor Pages: server rendered. Better than MVC. But FE and BE are not seperated
- Blazor: rendered with Razor components. Hosting options:
  - Blazor Server: rendered on server side. Using SignalR
  - WebAssembly: client rendered
- React SPA: client rendered

[MVC vs. Web API](https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/webapi/difference-between-aspnet-mvc-and-aspnet-web-api)

[Use the React project template with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/spa/react?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio)

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/about/)

[axios vs. fetch](https://betterprogramming.pub/rest-api-consumption-in-react-with-fetch-axios-and-axios-hooks-d9dd14b43c8b): Smaller app use fetch

[bower](https://bower.io/): package managenent

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): node.js package manager

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): chrome JS engine runtime

[gulp](https://gulpjs.com/): a toolkit to automate JS workflows

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): themeing

**Decision**: Backend use EF and SQLServer. Server use .NET Framework 6 Web App. Client use JS to interact with Web API. Bootstrap for basic UI, and later switch to React for better UI. Reasons are:

- Not use Web API with Swagger because the Identity plugin needs to be rendered with Web App.

[Prototype](https://github.com/ZhenyingZhu/StudyNotes/tree/master/dotnet-example/TodoApi)

## Swagger

[Getting Start](https://swagger.io/tools/open-source/getting-started/)

- [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kwmW_p_Tig). **[HERE]**: 20:50
- [swagger file path](Github\ToDoAndTracker\swagger.yaml)

- Use the `Swagger Editor` to create your OAS definition and then use `Swagger Codegen` to generate server implementation.
- `Swagger UI` is a collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from an OAS-compliant API.

[Swagger Editor Doc](https://swagger.io/docs/open-source-tools/swagger-editor/): Design API

[Swagger Editor Web Version](https://editor.swagger.io/?_ga=2.220049180.464638247.1646109938-1608438930.1646109938)

[Swagger CodeGen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen#getting-started)

[OpenAPI Spec](https://swagger.io/specification/)

[petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/pet/uploadFile)

Swagger can generate code with doc `AddSwaggerGen`.

Server

- Need to comment out the lagacy source in `swagger\server\NuGet.Config`

C# Client

- A C# program to call the RESTful APIs. Might be used in some programs talking to the RESTful APIs
- Uses [RestSharp](https://restsharp.dev/) as the HTTP client
  - How to use `InterceptRequest` and `InterceptResponse` **??**
- Each API has an async and a sync version
- Has a config class. Contains:
  - base URL
  - Default header
  - ApiKey, ApiKeyPrefix
  - username, password
  - access token
  - timeout
  - userAgent
- `{api}WithHttpInfo` is setting `Path`, `PathParams`, `QueryParams`, `HeaderParams`, `FormParams`, `FileParams`, `PostBody`, `HttpContentTypes`, `HttpHeaderAccepts`

## RESTful API Design

[API Design Pattern](https://blog.stoplight.io/api-design-patterns-for-rest-web-services)

HTTP Methods

- POST: return 201.
  - can set cache control in header
- PUT: update existing data. return 204
- PATCH: update subset of existing data. return 204
- GET: result is cached. should not be used to sensitive data. return 200.

Parameters

- Filtering: GET /users?age=30
- Pagination: /users?page=3&results_per_page=20
- Sorting: GET /users?sort_by=first_name&order=asc

[REST API Design Standard](https://blog.stoplight.io/rest-api-standards-do-they-even-exist)

- OAuth
- JSON PATCH

[CRUD API Design](https://blog.stoplight.io/crud-api-design)

- RPC: another design paradigm. executing commands instead of performing actions on resources
- Paths can indicate a hierarchy of subresources (/contacts/22/addresses), but should not be more than 2 levels of nesting
- resources should be lower case. use hyphen to seperate words (/legal-documents)
- use HTTP Accept header to config json or xml is supported
- actions break CRUD but can still be useful

Visual Studio Template

- GET api/{resources}: 200 with list of resources
- GET api/{resources}/{id}: 404 or 200 with the resource. Not return 401 or 403 so the user won't be able to tell if an id exist
- PUT api/{resources}/{id}: 404, 400 with error (e.g., if the id in the request doesn't match the url), or 204
- POST api/{resources}: 201 with the created resource. Not return 400 might because the validation is done in UI
- DELETE api/{resources}/{id}: 404 or 200

[API Key](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/)

- can be in URL query string, or in header, or in cookie
- defined scheme in `securitySchemes` using type `apiKey`. Define where it is in and what is the name

OpenAPI trival notes

- `x-codegen-request-body-name`: define the name of the request body. PUT and POST need it
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: HTML form

## ASP.NET Core Web API

ASP.NET Core configs

- default launch URL: `https://localhost:5001/swagger`. How to launch in public **??**
- How to config [HttpPlatformHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/extensions/httpplatformhandler/httpplatformhandler-configuration-reference) in web.config **??**
- logging: `appsettings.json` how to setup and how to see **??**
- [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)

[Tutorial: Create a web API with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio)

- `CreatedAtAction`: return 201 with the location in the response header points to the URI of the newly created resource
- `dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-httprepl`
- `ActionResult` ctor contains `actionName`, `routeValue`, `objectValue`
- [ActionResult vs IActionResult](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/action-return-types?view=aspnetcore-6.0#actionresult-vs-iactionresult). If return `NoContent`, use `IActionResult`, otherwise use `ActionResult` so the results can be converted to the HTTP response
- PUT method needs `_context.Entry(input).State = EntityState.Modified;` so the `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` can be thrown
- Data Transfer Object (DTO): hide some properties in the model. More details in [Preventing mass assignment or over posting in ASP.NET Core](https://andrewlock.net/preventing-mass-assignment-or-over-posting-in-asp-net-core/#:~:text=Mass%20assignment%2C%20also%20known%20as%20over-posting%2C%20is%20an,a%20developer%20did%20not%20expect%20to%20be%20set.)
- While handling `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` during PUT, check item exists is to deal with the case that the item is deleted by another caller.

Compare the WebAPI vs. WebApp

- WebApp: has Individual account auth support
- WebApp: has IIS support
- WebAPI: with swagger build in
- WebApp: has `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.EntityFrameworkCore` that shows the EF error page
- WebApp: has a Index.cshtml with `IndeModel` rendered
- WebApp: has `builder.Services.AddDatabaseDeveloperPageExceptionFilter();`
- WebApp: has `builder.Services.AddRazorPages();`
- WebAPI: has `builder.Services.AddControllers();` and `builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();`
- WebApp: has `app.UseStaticFiles();`, `app.UseRouting();` and `app.MapRazorPages();`

## Entity Framework Core

[Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/)

- object-relational mapper (O/RM)
- context object: represents a session with the database
- avoid common pitfalls:
  - need knowledge of primary and foreign keys, constraints, indexes, normalization, DML and DDL statements, data types, profiling, etc. **??**
  - test frameworks upgrade like ASP.NET Core, OData, or AutoMapper **??**
  - Performance and stress testing to catch inefficient operations: multiple collections Includes, heavy use of lazy loading, conditional queries on non-indexed columns, massive updates and inserts with store-generated values, lack of concurrency handling, large models, inadequate cache policy **??**
  - Security review: connection strings, secrets, database permissions, input validation for raw SQL, encryption for sensitive data **??**
  - failure scenarios: version rollback, fallback servers, scale-out and load balancing, DoS mitigation, and data backups **??**
  - App deployment/migration: data migration during app start might hit concurrency issue. Staging.

[Getting Started with EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/overview/first-app?tabs=visual-studio)

- `Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` to manage DB migration locally
  - `Add-Migration InitialCreate`
  - `Update-Database`
- The context class can inherit `IdentityDbContext` instead of `DBContext`. When use Identity scaffolding

- In `Program.CreateWebHostBuilder()`, calls `Startup.ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection)` to setup the DB.
  - SqlServer: `services.AddDbContext<SchoolContext>(options => options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));`
  - SQLite: `services.AddDbContext<MyDatabaseContext>(options => options.UseSqlite("Data Source=localdatabase.db"));`
  - With Identity:
    - `services.AddIdentity<StoreUser, IdentityRole>().AddEntityFrameworkStores<DutchContext>();` and `services.AddAuthentication().AddCookie().AddJwtBearer(cfg => { cfg.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters() });`
    - or `services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true).AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();`
    - then `services.AddDbContext()`
  - In memory: `services.AddDbContext<TodoContext>(options => options.UseInMemoryDatabase("TodoList"));`

- `DBContext.OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder)`: can be used to sets the DB context (e.g., connection string), but the best place is in the `Startup.ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection)`
  - [DbContextOptionsBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbcontextoptionsbuilder?view=efcore-6.0): set options with predefined setups
- `DBContext.OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder)` do actions when models are creating
  - `modelBuilder.Entity<Course>().ToTable("Course");`
  - Create compound index: `modelBuilder.Entity<CourseAssignment>().HasKey(c => new { c.CourseID, c.InstructorID });`
  - `modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().Property(p => p.Title).HasMaxLength(250);`
  - Seed an entry: `modelBuilder.Entity<AppTestModel>().HasData(new AppTestModel() { Id = 10, AppTestInput = "Seeding Test1" });`

[Managing Database Schemas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/)

- Migrations: when EF Core model is SOT
- Reverse Engineering: when DB schema is SOT
- [Create and Drop APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/ensure-created): `dbContext.Database.EnsureCreated();`. only for testing. A lightweight version of Migrations, but can only use one

[Migrations Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=vs)

- EF core compares the current model against a snapshot of the old model to generate migration file
- migration file can be applied to DB
- EF core records the applied migration in a history table
- Excluding parts of your model: can have the app getting data from multiple DB context. To avoid conflict, exclude the entity from current context
- In the Migrations folder, {timestamp}_{migration name}.cs are calling `migrationBuilder` to interact with DB
- `migrationBuilder.Sql(sqlQuery)`
- Generate SQL script to be applied in Prod: `Script-Migration <FromMigration> <ToMigration>`. If from migration is newer than to migration, it generates a rollback script
- `Script-Migration -Idempotent` can use the history table to generate SQL script automatically
- `Bundle-Migration` and then run the generated `.\efbundle.exe --connection 'Data Source=(local)\MSSQLSERVER;Initial Catalog=Blogging;User ID=myUsername;Password=myPassword'`
- App migration should not be used in Prod: In the `Main()`, `using (var scope = host.Services.CreateScope()) { var db = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ApplicationDbContext>(); db.Database.Migrate(); }`

[Error: "There was an error running the selected code generator: Package restore failed"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44509694/error-there-was-an-error-running-the-selected-code-generator-package-restore)

- The scaffold needs the latest NuGet package versions

[EF Core - adding/updating entity and adding/updating/removing child entities in one request](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48359363/ef-core-adding-updating-entity-and-adding-updating-removing-child-entities-in)

Models:

- Master
  - Id
  - SomeProperty
  - Children
  - SuperMaster: `[ForeignKey("SuperMasterId")]`
  - SuperMasterId
- Child
  - Id
  - SomeDescription
  - Count
  - Master: `[ForeignKey("MasterId")]`
  - MasterId
  - RelatedEntity: `[ForeignKey("RelatedEntityId")]`
  - RelatedEntityId

Controllers:

- `Master entity = Context.Masters.Include(x => x.SuperMaster).Include(x => x.Children).ThenInclude(x => x.RelatedEntity).FirstOrDefault(x => x.id == id)`
- `entity.Children.Add(Mapper.Map<Child>(child));`: // Mapper.Map uses AutoMapper to map from the input DTO to entity
- Child is created/updated directly in Child table, instead of letting EF updating the Master entity. If child.id is 0, create new one, is -1, delete, otherwise is updating. But this is bad pratice to update primary key as it messed up the EF tracking. Create a seperate list for recording them

[What Is Federated Identity?](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/what-is-federated-identity/)

- Federated identity: linking a user’s identity across multiple separate identity management systems
- Build on single sign-on (SSO) techniques
- agree on a set of shared principals
- Service providers trust Identity provider (IdP)
- Federated identity: an agreement between entities about the definition and use of those attributes
- laws of identity
  1. User control and consent
  2. Minimal disclosure: stored securely and deleted quickly
  3. Justification
  4. Directed identity: one company cannot have a permanent view of a user
  5. Competition: support multiple identity providers
  6. Human integration: need a real person to involve
  7. Consistency
- Federated identity management relies on strong agreements: what attributes are representative of who you are online. technologies
  - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
  - OAuth
  - OpenID
- security tokens: JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens and SAML assertions, to pass permissions from one platform to another
  - Pull OAuth credentials from Google's API: choose data like client id and client secrets that both Google and the company knows
  - Grab an access token from the Google Authorization Server
  - Compare the access scopes: compare that your request matches their willingness to share
  - Send the token to an API: Users are ready to gain access, as long as the token is included in an HTTP authorization request header

[strong agreements](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2285444/understanding-federated-identity.html)

- defining an identity for each user, associating attributes with the identity and enforcing a means by which a user can verify identity
- standardized means of representing attributes
- a user may have multiple identifiers associated with multiple roles, each with its own access permissions
- identity mapping: map identities and attributes of a user in one domain to the requirements of another domain
- IdP acquires attribute information through dialog and protocol exchanges with users and administrators
- Service providers: entities that obtain and employ data maintained and provided by identity providers, to support authorization decisions and to collect audit information
- management tasks: configuring systems to perform attribute transfers and identity mapping, and performing logging and auditing functions
- SAML: The principal standard for federated identity

[The Differences Between Standards](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/whats-the-difference-between-oauth-openid-connect-and-saml/#:~:text=The%20main%20differentiator%20between%20these,industry%20standards%20for%20federated%20authentication.)

- Federated Identity: a method of linking a user’s identity across multiple separate identity management systems
- OAuth 2.0: a framework that controls authZ to a protected resource
- OpenID Connect: industry standard for federated authN. Built on the OAuth 2.0 protocol and uses an additional JSON Web Token (JWT)
- SAML: another industry standard for federated authN. Independent of OAuth, relying on an exchange of messages to authenticate in XML SAML format

[Overview of ASP.NET Core authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

- schemes: The registered authentication handlers and their configuration options
  - `builder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme).AddJwtBearer(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options => builder.Configuration.Bind("JwtSettings", options)).AddCookie(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options => builder.Configuration.Bind("CookieSettings", options));`
  - `AddJwtBearer` and `AddCookie` are scheme specific extentions. The first parameter specify the scheme name
  - AuthZ policies can specify schemes to authN a user
  - Call UseAuthentication before any middleware that depends on users being authenticated
- AuthN provides the claims principal for AuthZ
- Multiple AuthN scheme approaches to select which authN handler to generate claims:
  - AuthN scheme
  - default authN scheme
  - directly set HttpContext.User
- AuthN handler: implements the behavior of a scheme. It creates `AuthenticationTicket` for a user when authN succeed. Also has methods to challenge (unauthN) and forbid (unauthZ)
- RemoteAuthenticationHandler: Async. OAuth 2.0 and OIDC both use this pattern. JWT and cookies don't
- Challenge: A cookie authentication scheme redirecting the user to a login page. A JWT bearer scheme returning a 401 result with a `www-authenticate: bearer` header.

- OpenId connect client: config and map claims

[Authentication and authorization for SPAs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

- Duende IdentityServer implements OpenID Connect
- `services.AddIdentityServer().AddApiAuthorization<ApplicationUser, ApplicationDbContext>();` to use IdentityServer
- `app.UseIdentityServer();` to expose OpenID connect endpoints
- Use `services.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(schemeName, options => {})` to config API authN handler
- API's JWT handler raises `JwtBearerEvents`. AddIdentityServerJwt registers its own event handlers.
- For client: `const token = await authService.getAccessToken();`, then add the token to header 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`.
- When deploy to prod, need resources to be provisioned:
  - a DB to store identity user accounts and IdentityServer grants
  - A production certificate to use for signing tokens
- For web hosting provider, in the `appsettings.json`, can add `IdentityServer` section to define where is the key and what is the CN of the key.

[Tutorial: Call an ASP.NET Core web API with JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-javascript?view=aspnetcore-6.0)

- [What Does javascript:void(0); Mean?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-void-keyword-explained/)
- flows
  - view: a table. `getItems()` is called at the end of rendering the html
    - `getItems()` calls `GET uri` and gets the response json, then call `_displayItems()` that sets the view table and the counter
    - `_displayItems()` first clean the view table, then create a row for each todo item, then stores the todo items in an array. `cloneNode` is faster than `createElement`, so use `cloneNode` as much as possible
    - `Edit` button `onclick` calls `displayEditForm(id)`. It reads an todo item from the array, then binds the fields to the edit form, then unhides the form
    - `Delete` button `onclick` calls `deleteItem(id)`. It calls `DELETE uri/id`, then `getItems()`
  - add: a form, `onsubmit` calls `addItem()` with `POST` method. Submit button `Add`
    - `addItem()` reads input from the form, calls `trim()` for the text input, then calls `POST uri`, but not uses the result, and instead calls `getItems()`, then cleans the input form
  - update: a form, normally hidden. `onsubmit` calls `updateItem()` without set method. Submit button `Save`
    - `aria-label` is set for the inavtive button `X` (`&#10006;`). It calls `closeInput()` when `onclick`
    - `updateItem()` reads input from the form, then `parseInt()` on int and `trim()` on string, then calls `PUT uri/id`, and then calls `getItems()`. `closeInput()` is called outside the async, because even the call fails, it also hides the form. Return false to stop default form submission

[Handling status 500 with try and catch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70709770/handling-status-500-with-try-and-catch#:~:text=1%20Take%20a%20look%20at%20the%20Fetch%20docs%3A,the%20promise%20resolves%20and%20no%20error%20is%20thrown.)

- `fetch` returns 500 doesn't go to `catch` block.
