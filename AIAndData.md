## Big Data

### Map Reduce

Map:

- Key: file location
- Value: file content

Reduce:

- Key, value: OutputCollector returned by Map, which values are already sorted, and only for this key.

```java
void Map::map(Key key, Value value, OutputCollector<ReduceKey, ReduceValue> output);

void Reduce::reduce(ReduceKey key, Iterator<ReduceValue> values, OutputCollector<OutputKey, OutputValue> output);
```

#### BFS

<http://www.johnandcailin.com/blog/cailin/breadth-first-graph-search-using-iterative-map-reduce-algorithm>

```java
void map(int nodeID, string nodeStruct, OutputCollector<int, string> output) {
    Node node = parseStruct(nodeStruct); // edges|dist|status
    if (node.status == visiting) {
        for (int neiID : node.edges) {
            Node nei = {NULL, node.dist + 1, visiting};
            output.collect(neiID, nei.to_string());
        }
        node.status= visited;
    }
    output.collect(nodeID, node.to_string());
}

void reducer(int nodeID, Iterator<string> nodeStructs, OutputCollector<int, string> output) {
    Node node;
    for (string structStr : nodeStructs) {
        Node nodeStruct = parseStruct(structStr);
        if (nodeStruct.edges != NULL)
            node.edges = nodeStruct.edges;
        if (nodeStruct.dist < node.dist) // default is INT_MAX
            node.dist = nodeStruct.dist;
        if (nodeStruct.status > node.status) // visited > visiting > none
            node.status = nodeStruct.status;
    }
    output.collect(nodeID, node.to_string());
}
```

## AI

techniques:

- machine learning
- deep learning
- neural networks
- natural language processing

Generative AI

- Language model: encapsulate semantic relationships between language elements. large language models vs. SLM

Computer vision

- Image classification
- Object detection: OCR
- Image segmentation

Speech

- Speech recognition
- Speech synthesis: text-to-voice

Natural language processing

- not necessarily using GenAI
- entity extraction
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis

Products:

- Udio: From composing music based on a couple of quick prompts
- Obsidian: taking notes and organizing your thoughts
- Tray.ai: automating and connecting services
- Cursor: dedicated programs
- M365 Copilot: sensitive internal corp information

## Github Copilot

<https://github.com/features/copilot>

- /tests Generate unit tests for this function. Validate both success and failure, and include edge cases.
- Improve the variable names in this function. Can use copilot edits

<https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart?tool=vscode>

- Ask Copilot for help using the command line
- knowledge bases: Create and manage collections of documentation
- Code completion: next edit suggestions
- Copilot Edits: across multiple files directly from a single Copilot Chat prompt
  - Edit mode vs. agent mode

<https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/best-practices-for-using-github-copilot>

- Code completions
- built-in keywords
- tell Copilot Chat that it is a Senior C++ Developer who cares greatly about code quality, readability, and efficiency, then ask it to review your code
- Break down complex tasks.
- Be specific about your requirements.
- Provide examples of things like input data, outputs, and implementations.
- Follow good coding practices.
- Review suggestion.
- open relevant files and close irrelevant files.

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to let AI understand about the project

<https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers>

- MCP hosts: IDEs, programs
- MCP clients: protocol clients maintaining connections
- MCP servers: services work with MCP like git
- Local resources/internet services

- `Cline: Open In New Tab`
- `Hello Cline! I need help setting up my Windows PC for software development. Could you please help me install the essential development tools like Node.js, Git, and any other core utilities that are commonly needed for coding? I'd like you to guide me through the process step-by-step.`

<https://docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/prompting>

- `.clinerules` file

<https://docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/cline-memory-bank>

Can let it create a MCP server.

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

Any AI tools for Outlook? Copilot is very stupid.

Use Microsoft Graph API + Python/OpenAI/GPT to extract and classify emails.
